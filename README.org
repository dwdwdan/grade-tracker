#+TITLE: gradeTracker

This is a WIP CLI written in python for tracking grades. It stores the data in a yaml file. It currently has no real UX, the main script has to be edited to change what it does, though this is definitely on my todo list.

* Installation
To install this (idk why you'd want to but go ahead) just run

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/dwdwdan/gradeTracker.git
#+end_example

The data is stored in ~data.yml~ but this file can be changes with the ~--config-file~ flag
